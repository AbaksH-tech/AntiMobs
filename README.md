This plugin allows you to disable hostile mobs in a designated area, and also disables creeper and TNT explosions. It's well-suited for spawn areas and vanilla servers that want to avoid using region protection plugins.

Commands:

/ampos1 - Selects the first point.

/ampos2 - Selects the second point.

/amsave - Saves the selected area.
